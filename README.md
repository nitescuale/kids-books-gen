## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server won't start / Port in use:**
```bash
# Change port in story-server.js (line 7)
const port = 3003; // or any available port
```

**API Key Issues:**
- Ensure `.env` file is in the root directory
- Check that your API key is valid and has credits
- Verify the key starts with `sk-ant-api`

**Stories not generating:**
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify server logs for Claude API errors
- Ensure internet connection is stable

### Checking Server Logs
The server provides detailed logging:
- `✅ Claude SDK initialized` - API connection successful
- `💡 Generating example story ideas...` - Example generation in progress
- `📝 Generating story for input:` - Story generation started
- `❌ Error` messages - Check for API issues

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control
- The `.gitignore` file already excludes `.env` from git
- Your Claude API key should be treated as a password

## 📝 Development

### Making Changes
1. Edit `story-server.js` for backend changes
2. Edit `index.html` for frontend changes
3. Restart the server to see backend changes
4. Refresh browser for frontend changes

### Adding New Features
- Add new API endpoints in `story-server.js`
- Customize the Claude prompts for different story styles
- Modify the UI in `index.html` for new functionality
